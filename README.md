# -Pearl-of-the-Indian-Ocean-Tourist-Website-
I have created a website that displays tourist information about Sri Lanka. My website name is “Pearl of the Indian Ocean.” My website has a Home page, an About Us page, a Tourist Places Information Page, a Gallery page, a To-Do List page, and a Contact Us page. I have created my website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the VueJs Framework.
